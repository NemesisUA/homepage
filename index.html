      <p>Essentially, handling the date in JavaScript means counting the milliseconds from this time:</p>
      <p>00:00:00 January 1, 1970</p>
      <p>And that's all.</p>
      <p>Well, if this is that simple, <i>what could go wrong?</i></p>

        <p>Let's start with that innocent looking 3 characters: UTC. UTC means: Coordinated Universal Time.
          UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is effectively a successor to
          Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
          It also means, that the time we'd need to handle will be time zone dependent.</p>
